5. Now click around on the site to verify the beacons are being sent and check in Dynatrace to validate data is coming in. If you're not seeing beacons with HTTP status 200, try opening the website in a new tab or window and validate the following: 1. The Dynatrace RUM JavaScript tag is injected on the page, in the `<header>` of the html 2. There aren't any CSP errors in the Console 3. The URL pattern and source URL are correct in the extension configuration ![configure extension and hard refresh find beacon](docs/imgs/real-user_configure_extension_hard_refresh_find_beacon.gif)

> The RUM Injector Extension UI now provides the ability to identify your user (add a user tag) within the extension itself, as well as the ability to find your session in the tenant.

> (Alternatively, use `dtrum.identifyUser('user-name')`)

> Normally, **RUM** sessions end on of the ways documented here: [https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/user-session#user-session-end]()
> However, we want to be able to create a bunch of sessions quickly without having to close the browser or wait for inactivity. To do this, navigate to the console in Chrome Dev Tools and type `dtrum.endSession()` and hit enter
