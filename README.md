The Dynatrace RUM JavaScript tag is injected on the page, in the `<header>` of the html 2. There aren't any CSP errors in the Console 3. The URL pattern and source URL are correct in the extension configuration ![configure extension and hard refresh find beacon](docs/imgs/real-user_configure_extension_hard_refresh_find_beacon.gif)

> The RUM Injector Extension UI now provides the ability to identify your user (add a user tag) within the extension itself, as well as the ability to find your session in the tenant.

> (Alternatively, use `dtrum.identifyUser('user-name')`)

> Normally, **RUM** sessions end on of the ways documented here: [https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/user-session#user-session-end]()
> However, we want to be able to create a bunch of sessions quickly without having to close the browser or wait for inactivity. To do this, navigate to the console in Chrome Dev Tools and type `dtrum.endSession()` and hit enter
